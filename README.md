BackNode
========

POC for [CIFACOM](http://www.cifacom.com/) Week project

[BackNode is GPL](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html)

## Webdesigner guide

This is how to make an HTML page editable by content writers and clients in [BackNode](http://www.backnode.io/).

First open the HTML file in a text editor.

### Make text fields editable

For all the nodes which are texts and which you want to be editable in BackNode, add the css class ```backnode-text``` or the HTML attribute ```data-bn="text"```.

### Make images editable

For all the nodes which are images and which you want to be editable in BackNode, add the css class ```backnode-image``` or the HTML attribute ```data-bn="image"```.

### Make HTML pages with Silex

The HTML pages created with [Silex website builder](http://www.silex.me) can also be edited in BackNode. The designer has to enter the advanced mode of Silex - tools > Apollo mode, and add the css classes provided above to the desired elements.
